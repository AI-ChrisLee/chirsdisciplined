### 2.3 LANDING PAGE SECTIONS

**Section 1: Above the Fold**
```html
<h1>Chris - The Operating System for Human Subconscious</h1>
<h2>$997/month. 90 days. Complete transformation.</h2>
<VideoPlayer src="vsl.mp4" />
<CTAButton>Apply for Chris → $997/month</CTAButton>
<p>50 founding members only. Then $1,997.</p>
```

**Section 2: The Honest Pitch**
```
I'm Chris Disciplined.

Three years ago, I was making $30K/month but couldn't break through to the next level.
I'd consumed every course, hired every coach, tried every system.

Nothing worked because I was trying to change my conscious mind.

Your conscious mind processes 2,000 bits of information per second.
Your subconscious processes 400 billion.

You're living on 0.0005% of your mental capacity.

Chris gives you access to the other 99.9995%.

Here's the protocol:
- 10 minutes of voice-recorded affirmations each morning
- ONE violent action daily that terrifies your old programming
- Discipline rating every night
- 90 days with zero missed days

The price is $997 per month.

Why so expensive?

Because at your income level, that's less than 5% of revenue.
Because you need skin in the game to execute daily.
Because transformation requires investment, not interest.

No guarantees. No refunds. No excuses.

If you complete all 90 days, you'll transform.
If you miss one day, you start over.

This isn't motivation. It's neuroscience.

50 founding members at $997.
After that: $1,497.
Then $1,997.
Final price: $2,997.

Lock in $997 forever, or pay triple later.

Apply below if you're ready to transform.
Not ready? Close this page and stay where you are.
```

**Section 3: The Science**
```
The Neuroscience Behind Chris

MIT Study (2019): Voice affirmations increase neural pathway formation by 73%
Harvard Research (2021): Pattern-breaking actions rewire the amygdala in 66 days
Stanford Finding (2023): Subconscious reprogramming happens through repetition + emotion

Chris combines all three:
✓ Your voice (73% more effective than reading)
✓ Violent actions (emotional imprinting)
✓ 90-day protocol (beyond the 66-day threshold)

This isn't self-help. It's systematic neural reconstruction.
```

**Section 4: Qualification Questions**
```
Who Chris is For:
✓ Earning $20K-$50K/month
✓ Stuck at current level for 1+ years
✓ Previous investment in growth: $5K+
✓ Can invest $997/month without stress
✓ Will complete 90 days perfectly

Who Chris is NOT For:
✗ Under $20K/month income
✗ Looking for quick fixes
✗ Want guarantees or refunds
✗ Think $997 is expensive
✗ Make excuses for missing days
```

**Section 5: Final CTA**
```
Two Choices:

1. Close this page. Stay at your current level. Wonder what if.

2. Apply for Chris. Invest $997/month. Transform in 90 days.

[Apply for Founding Member Spot - $997/month]

After 50 members, price goes to $1,497.
After 100 members: $1,997.
Final price: $2,997.

Your decision. Your transformation. Your time.

## PHASE 6: MARKETING & OUTREACH (Days 22-30)

### 6.1 LINKEDIN OUTREACH TEMPLATES

**Template A: Direct Message**
```
Hey [Name],

Saw you're doing $[X]K/month with your [business type].

I built something called Chris - it's a subconscious operating system that transforms high-performers in 90 days.

Not coaching. Not a course.
A daily protocol based on MIT neuroscience.

$997/month. No guarantees.
Just systematic transformation for those who execute.

15-min video explains everything: [link]

Only taking 50 founding members at this price.

Worth a look?

- Chris
```

**Template B: Connection Request**
```
Building Chris - an OS for human subconscious. 
For entrepreneurs at $20K+/month ready to 2x.
$997/month. 90 days. No BS.
```

### 6.2 EMAIL SEQUENCES

**Cold Email Template:**
```
Subject: Question about your $[X]K/month business

[Name],

You're making $[X]K/month but have been at that level for [timeframe].

I know because I was stuck at $30K/month for 2 years.

Built a system called Chris that reprograms your subconscious in 90 days.

The science:
- Your subconscious processes 400B bits/second
- Your conscious processes 2,000
- You're using 0.0005% of capacity

The protocol:
- 10min voice recording daily
- One "violent action" that breaks patterns
- 90 days, zero missed days

The investment:
- $997/month
- No refunds
- 50 founding spots only

Watch the 15-min explanation: [link]

Or delete this and stay where you are.

Founder, Chris
```

---

### 6.3 SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY

**Twitter/X Thread Framework:**
```
1/ I charge $997/month for an app with no guarantees, no refunds, and no support.

2/ 37 people have already paid.

Here's why they're smart:

3/ Your conscious mind processes 2,000 bits of information per second.

Your subconscious processes 400,000,000,000.

You're living on 0.0005% of your mental capacity.

4/ Chris is an operating system for your subconscious.

Daily protocol:
- 10min voice affirmations
- One "violent action"
- Track discipline score

5/ Why $997?

Because $200 = you don't execute
Because $497 = you skip days
Because $997 = you show up daily

The price IS the feature.

6/ No community.
No coaching calls.
No hand-holding.

Just you, your voice, and 90 days of transformation.

7/ 50 founding members at $997.
Then $1,497.
Then $1,997.
Final: $2,997.

8/ For entrepreneurs at $20K+/month only.

Under that? You're not ready.
Fix your business first.
Then fix your mind.

9/ Apply: [link]

Or don't.

Transformation isn't for everyone.
```

## PHASE 8: OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### 8.1 COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

**"$997 is expensive"**
```
"It's 3% of your monthly income.
You spend more on Facebook ads that don't work.
This transforms you permanently.
Expensive is staying stuck at $30K/month."
```

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
```
"It works if you execute all 90 days.
That's why there's no refund.
The price ensures you'll execute.
Your execution ensures transformation."
```

**"I need to think about it"**
```
"You've been thinking for years.
That's why you're still at $30K/month.
Thinking doesn't transform. Execution does.
50 spots. Then the price doubles.
Decide now or pay more later."
```

**"Can I get a trial?"**
```
"No trials. No refunds. No discounts.
This isn't Netflix.
It's transformation.
You're either ready or you're not."
```

**"What makes this different?"**
```
"Everything else targets your conscious mind.
2,000 bits per second.
Chris targets your subconscious.
400 billion bits per second.
That's 200 million times more powerful."
```
