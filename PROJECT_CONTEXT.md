## 11. CONVERSATION STARTERS FOR AI

When you share this document with Claude or another AI, start with:

"I'm Chris Disciplined, building a $997/month subconscious operating system called Chris. I have a working MVP frontend in Next.js. Read this context document and help me with [specific request]."

### Good Questions to Ask AI:
1. "How do I integrate Stripe payments without a backend?"
2. "Write me 10 DM templates for LinkedIn outreach"
3. "Create a 30-day content calendar for building in public"
4. "What's the minimal Supabase setup needed for 50 users?"
5. "Write a sales script for my qualification calls"

---

## 12. VALUE JUSTIFICATION FRAMEWORK

### The $997/Month Math
```
Customer Current State: $30,000/month
After Chris: $60,000/month (conservative 2x)
Monthly Gain: $30,000

Chris Cost: $997/month
ROI: 30x monthly return
Investment: 3.3% of current income
Return: 100%+ income increase
```

### New Value Stack
- Subconscious Operating System: $5,000 value
- Daily Voice Protocol: $2,000 value
- Violent Action Framework: $2,000 value
- 90-Day Transformation: $10,000 value
- Founder Access (first 50): $3,000 value
- **Total Value: $22,000**
- **Their Price: $997/month (95% discount)**

### Objection Handlers
- "$997 is expensive" → "It's 3% of your income for 100% transformation"
- "No guarantees?" → "The price ensures your execution. Your execution ensures results."
- "I need to think" → "You've been thinking for years. That's why you're stuck."

4. **Customer Success:** First 10 must get results
5. **Speed:** Launch in 7 days, not 7 weeks

### What Must NOT Happen
1. **Feature Creep:** Don't add features before 50 customers
2. **Price Drops:** Never discount, only increase
3. **Wrong Customers:** Better to have 10 right than 100 wrong

5. **Backend First:** Validate with manual process first
