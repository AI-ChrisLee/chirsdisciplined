            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Chris Disciplined provides a systematic training protocol for subconscious programming through voice recording, violent action tracking, and disciplined feedback. We are building the Operating System for Human Subconscious.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The Service includes:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Daily voice recording and affirmation tools</li>
              <li>Vision board creation and visualization features</li>
              <li>Violent action tracking and accountability</li>
              <li>Evening feedback and discipline rating system</li>
              <li>Sleep programming functionality</li>

            </h2>

              This is the most important section. Read it twice.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We offer NO REFUNDS under any circumstances. Your $997 monthly investment is gone the moment you pay, whether you execute the protocol or not. This is not cruelty—it's transformation psychology. When you have no escape route, your subconscious must commit fully.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We offer NO GUARANTEES of specific results. The system works if you work. Complete the daily protocol with perfect consistency and transformation is inevitable. Miss one day and you start over. This is neuroscience, not our rule.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              If you need guarantees, you're not ready for transformation. Transformation requires burning the boats. The $997 with no refund is your boat burning ceremony.

              6. Founding Membership & Pricing
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Founding membership is limited to the first 50 members at $997 per month, locked forever. After the founding members, the price increases to $1,497, then $1,997, then $2,997.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The $997 price IS the first violent action. When entrepreneurs earning $20-50K/month see $997, their subconscious immediately resists. That resistance is poverty consciousness protecting itself. By paying $997, they take their first violent action against their old programming.
